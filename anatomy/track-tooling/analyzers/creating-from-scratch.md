# Creating an Analyzer

Firstly, thank you for your interest in creating an Analyzer!

These are the steps to get going:

1. Check [our repository list for an existing `...-analyzer`](https://github.com/exercism?q=-analyzer) to ensure that one doesn't already exist.
2. Scan the [contents of this directory](./) to ensure you are comfortable with the idea of creating an Analyzer.
3. Open an issue at [exercism/exercism](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/new) introducing yourself and telling us which language you'd like to create a Analayzer for.

We have an incredibly friendly and supportive community who will be happy to help you as you work through this! Just create new issues in this repository as needed :slightly-smiling-face:
