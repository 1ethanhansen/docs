# Reputation

Reputation is the system that allows people to acquire "trust" within the Exericsm ecosystem.

Reputation is a measure of how much an individual has contributed to Exercism, both through contribution to the platform (e.g. through creation of software, exercises and docs) and contribution to the community (e.g. mentoring).

Reputation cannot be "spent" or "used". However, achieving certain Reputation thresholds gives access to new priviledges and ways to contribute. Put simply, the more reputation an individual has, the more we feel we can trust them, and so the more power they receive. Reputation is also a publically-viewable measure of how much you have given to Exercism.
