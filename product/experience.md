# Experience

Experience is Exercism's way of representing how proficient you are at completing exercises on Exercism.

Experience is acquired by completing exercises successfully.

## Allocation of Experience

Experience is allocated on successful exercise completion, whether concept or practice.

Learners are able to earn up to a maximum amount of experience points per exercise. This allocation should grow as a learner progresses through Exercism, allowing learners to earn more points as they proceed further and further with practice exercises.

Max experience allocation should vary per exercise. A reliable method of assigning experience point allocation per exercise has yet to be decided.

## Levels

Much like any modern roleplaying game, experience points are accrued and represented as a level. Levels go from 1-99, progressively getting more difficult to level up.

Level ranges are tagged by a label.

### Level Tags

Level tags are denominated as the following:
- 1 - 9 : Newbie
- 10 - 19 : Explorer
- 20 - 39 : Adventurer
- 40 - 59 : Pathfinder
- 60 - 79 : Reaver
- 80 - 89 : Overseer
- 90 - 98 : Mystic
- 99 : Apex

## Future Considerations

- Allocation of experience points based on how well you did on the exercise, such as how idiomatic the solution was, or other, more quantifiable and valuable indicators. We could explore looking at awarding those who may have submitted an initial messy iteration, and really took the time to evolve their solution into something better. Another idea would be to award more experience points to those who successfully complete analyser feedback.
