# Test Runners

The Test Runner is a piece of software that runs a solution's tests once it's submitted.

Test runners give us two advantages
1. They enable in-browser coding, where a student can iterate on a solution seeing whether the tests pass or fail. 
2. They allow us to provide information to mentors on whether a student's code "works" or not.

Each language has it's own test runner. The website acts as the orchestrator between the test runners and the submissions.
